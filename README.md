# Introduction to Python

This is the repository for the “[Introduction to Python](http://senereko.ceres.rub.de/hnrws2015-en/program/introduction-python/)” session at the [Historical Network Research workshop 2015](http://senereko.ceres.rub.de/hnrws2015/).

## Prerequisites

First, you need to install Python. There are two versions of Python: Version 2, which is older, but still used, and the newer Version 3. We will use Python 3.

The easiest way to get Python with all the additional modules that we will use is the Anaconda installer.

1. Go to [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads).
2. Click “I want Python 3.4.”
3. Click the download button: “Your Operating System — Python 3.4.”
4. Follow the installation instructions.

## Running Python

We will use “IPython Notebook” to write Python code. It allows you to run snippets of Python in a web browser and immediately see the results.

### MacOS and Windows

There is a utility called “Launcher.” Open it and select “IPython Notebook” from the window.

### MacOS and Linux

Open a Terminal window and type:

    ipython notebook

If you want to store your notebooks in a custom directory, then you can change into that directory first:

    cd ~/Documents/MyNotebooks
    ipython notebook

In order to check you are using the Anaconda version of Python, and not the one that comes with your operating system, run

    python --version

The output should look like this:

    Python 3.4.1 :: Anaconda 2.1.0 (64-bit)

## Using this repository

This repository will contain the examples from the session.
