    "When using Python for humanities research, one of the most important aspects is working with data. The task that David Mimno calls [data carpentry](http://www.mimno.org/articles/carpentry/) comprises getting data, cleaning data, enrichting data, and converting data from one form into another. Most of this can be done manually in principle, but it is mostly time consuming routine work that is not intellectually challenging. So it is a good task for a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we deal with data formats commonly used in the humanities, we should learn a bit about data types in Python. We already learned about three important data types: “String,” which basically means “text”, “integer,” and “float,” which both are numbers, but one can contain fractions. The quotes (both `'` and `\"` work) distinguish text from numbers, the decimal point distinguishes integers from floats. The distinction is important, since some functions and methods work only with certain types of data, or they behave differently. Take this example:"
